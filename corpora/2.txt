User: I have a job interview tomorrow and I'm super nervous.
AI: I totally get that. Nervous is normal. What’s the job role?
User: It's for a frontend developer position at a startup.
AI: Okay, frontend. Do you know what tech stack they use?
User: Mostly React and TypeScript, I think.
AI: Great! React and TypeScript—very in-demand. Have you worked with both?
User: Yes, React a lot. TypeScript a little less, but yes.
AI: That’s good enough. Want to do a quick mock question?
User: Yes, please. That would help.
AI: Alright. How would you manage global state in a large React app?
User: Probably with Context API or Redux.
AI: Nice, nice. Mention why and maybe compare both briefly.
User: Got it. This helps a lot, really.
AI: You’ve got this! Deep breath, be confident, and show what you know.
User: Thanks again. Feeling better already.
